## Introduction

### Aims
The aims for this project are:
> To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools,
methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules
covered during training.

For me this means:
1. Utilise CRUD within the program created by me.
2. Use JIRA to develop a methodology.
3. Create an Entity Relationship Database (has to have a one-to-many relationship)
4. Assess all risks and create a risk assessment detailing this.
5. Build tests that will test the functionality of the application.
6. Fully integrated with GitHub.
7. Use Flask for front-end on website production.

### My Idea
I have decided to create an application for farmers which will enable them to both sell their goods to customers as well as lend tools to other farmers. Other farmers can then rent out tools from others as well as put up stock for any new goods.

The CRUD for this application is outlined below:

#### Create:
* Farmers details
* Goods stock 
  * Vegetables
  * Fruits
  * Meat
  * Dairy
* Tools
  * Vehicles
  * Power tools
#### Read:
* Available produce to purchase
* Tools to rent
#### Update:
* Farmers details
* Stock amount
#### Delete:
* Farmers details
* Goods
* Tools

## Architecture:
### Risk Assessment:
Below I have created a risk assessment which outlines the various risks with the application development and the application itself alongside the potential fixes.
