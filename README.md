# Farmers Market 
## Contents


## Introduction

### Aims
The aims for this project are:
> To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools,
methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules
covered during training.

For me this means:
1. Utilise CRUD within the program created by me.
2. Use JIRA to develop a methodology.
3. Create an Entity Relationship Database (has to have a one-to-many relationship)
4. Assess all risks and create a risk assessment detailing this.
5. Build tests that will test the functionality of the application.
6. Fully integrated with GitHub.
7. Use Flask for front-end on website production.

### My Idea
I have decided to create an application for farmers which will enable them to both sell their goods to customers as well as lend tools to other farmers. Other farmers can then rent out tools from others as well as put up stock for any new goods.

The CRUD for this application is outlined below:

#### Create:
* Farmers details
* Goods stock 
  * Vegetables
  * Fruits
  * Meat
  * Dairy
* Tools
  * Vehicles
  * Power tools
#### Read:
* Available produce to purchase
* Tools to rent
#### Update:
* Farmers details
* Stock amount
#### Delete:
* Farmers details
* Goods
* Tools

## Architecture:
### Risk Assessment:
Below I have created a risk assessment which outlines the various risks with the application development and the application itself alongside the potential fixes.

### JIRA BOARD:
Below is how I have documented my progress of the project using JIRA. This application was used as it was the one that I am well-versed in and it is fairly easy to use.

This board will get updated and the full board can be accessed at: https://thushithqa.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/FM/boards/2/roadmap

### Entity Relationship Diagram:
Below is the current Entity Relationship Diagram I have developed. This will get developed as more sections are added onto the project, however for now as shown it satisfies the aim of a one-to-many relationship database.

A one-to-many relationship was used for this application solely due to the fact that this is what is required for application.
